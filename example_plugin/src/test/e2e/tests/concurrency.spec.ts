/**
 * `concurrency` fans a test (or a `describe.serial` block) out into N independent bots running
 * at once — the shape a race between real players needs. These also stand in as regression
 * coverage for the two bugs that concurrency exposed in the previously-sequential-only runner:
 *  - `session.consoleLog` used to be wiped by `clear()` at the start of every test; N bots
 *    writing into it at once would have raced. Each instance now reads from its own
 *    `ServerWrapper.startIndex` cursor instead, so its own marker is never missed no matter what
 *    the other instances are doing to the same shared log.
 *  - `createBotScope.close()` used to disconnect every bot in the session, not just its own —
 *    the first instance to finish would have kicked every other still-running instance's bot.
